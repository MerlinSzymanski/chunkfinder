In some scientific papers we find photoshoped pictures of gels or plots.
Since these "duplications" within the pictures are not always recognized easily
this projekt aims to develop a program which recognises clusters of identical 
pixels within a picture.

Disclaimer:
This is a hobby project, dont expect much. 
By now, only a simple framework exists 
 - open a picture
 - sliding window-approach to create "sub-pictures"
 - compare sub-windows
 - color identical windows in the same color

However, there seems to be no perfect 100% pixel-match even in artificial
pictures... So there is a need of more simplification
